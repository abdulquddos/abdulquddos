I'm a results-driven .NET Software Developer with over 15+ years of experience building scalable, secure, and user-focused applications across FinTech, EdTech, Insurance, and eCommerce domains. 

Over 7 years of experience developing and maintaining Novatraq, a FinTech platform focused on automating loan processing workflows for financial institutions and SBA lenders. Key modules included borrower portals, FICO integration, SBA E-Tran integration, credit scoring, DocuSign e-signatures, reporting dashboards, and third-party API integrations.

With a strong foundation in C#, ASP.NET Core, REST APIs, Microservices, SQL Server, and modern front-end technologies, I’ve led the development of systems like learning management platforms, digital banking modules, insurance policy portals, and eCommerce tools.

🔹 Comfortable working independently or as part of distributed teams <br>
🔹 Agile/Scrum practitioner with strong communication and time management skills <br>
🔹 Passionate about clean code, reusable architecture, and delivering value <br>

As I continue to grow, I'm also exploring how to integrate AI and machine learning into traditional software systems to build more intelligent, future-ready applications.
